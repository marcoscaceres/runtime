        This document specifies two classes of Web application: <em>hosted Web
        applications</em> and <em>packaged applications</em>. These
        applications differ from traditional Web applications in their life
        cycle, security model, and access to APIs that are not normally
        available to Web applications. Conceptually, the application manifest
        indicates that an application can be "installed" on an end-user's
        device. What distinguishes a traditional Web application from a hosted
        web application is an application manifest: this is a JSON resource
        that contains application specific metadata (e.g., the name of the
        application), and optionally various security related permission
        requests to resources on the Web and/or services and capabilities on
        the device.

          The figure shows the overlap between traditional web applications,
          hosted web applications, and packaged applications. Web applications
          make use of standard Web technologies but don't make use of an
          application manifest. On the other hand, hosted applications make use
          of an application manifest, while packaged applications have both an
          application manifest and are packaged using [[!ZIP]].
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Installation of hosted or packaged applications onto a device can be
        initiated through either linking to an application manifest or through
        the use of the <code>ApplicationRegistry</code> API. This API gives a
        developer a degree of control over the installation process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification also specifies aspects related to the application's
        lifecycle that are outside the control of the developer. These events
        sometimes result in <em>system messages</em> being generated.
        Developers can register event listeners to listen for these special
        events during the life cycle of their application.

        Application Manifest and its members
      </h2>
      <p>
        An <dfn>application manifest</dfn> is a JSON document [[!RFC4627]] that
        describes various aspects of a <a>packaged application</a> or hosted
        web application. Some of these aspects are presentational, others
        aspects have security sensitive implications. An application manifest
        consists of a top-level object (the <dfn>manifest root</dfn>) and one
        or more members, some of which can themselves contain objects.

        the algorithms, to <dfn>ignore</dfn> means that the user agent MUST act
        as if the author had not declared the particular member in the
        application manifest document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain error conditions can result in an <a>application manifest</a>
        being treated as an <a>invalid manifest</a>. An <dfn>invalid
        manifest</dfn> is an application manifest that is deemed to be
        non-conforming in such a way that it would not be possible for the user
        agent to continue processing (e.g., it can't be parsed by the JSON
        parser). In such a case, the user agent may report the error to the
        user in a user-agent-specific manner, may <a href=
        "http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#navigate">navigate</a>
        to an error page to report the error, or may ignore the error and do
        nothing. In either case, when a step results in an <a>invalid
        manifest</a> the user agent MUST abort whatever steps caused the
        condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>steps for fetching an application manifest</dfn> are given by
        the following algorithm. This algorithm can be applied equally to
        manifests fetched from HTTP/S or those derived over the app URI scheme.

        application manifest as an <a>invalid manifest</a>.

                <li>from <var>default locale</var>.

                <li>If there is no occurance of <var>default locale</var> in

          As the manifest format is a JSON document, this doucment relies on

          <dfn id="json-number">number</dfn>, and <dfn id=
          "json-string">string</dfn>. Strict validation checking to types is
          not enforced by this specification. Instead, each member definition

          Internationalization and localization
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>user agent's locales</dfn> is an ordered list of <a title=
          "language tag">language tags</a> that are used to represent the
          end-user's language(s) and localization preference for experiencing
          content; these are essentially equivalent to the language tags sent
          by the user agent through the <code>Accept-Language</code> [[HTTP11]]
          header, but without the quality values.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case sensitivity and case mapping for language tags is the same
          as that defined in section 6.1 of the ECMAScript Internationalization
          API Specification [[!ECMAS-402]]
        </p>
        <p>
          As there are numerous ways a user agent can derive the end-user's
          preferred languages and regional settings (e.g., the end user might
          have set them in the user agent's preferences), the means by which
          those values are derived are left up to the implementation. The first
          item of the <a>user agent's locales</a> represents the user's most
          preferred language range (i.e., the language/region combination the
          user agent assumes the end-user most prefers), followed by the next
          most preferred language range, and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>language tag</dfn> is a string that matches the production of
          a <code>Language-Tag</code> defined in the [[!BCP47]] specifications
          (see the <a href=
          "http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">IANA
          Language Subtag Registry</a> for an authoritative list of possible
          values, see also the <a href=
          "http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/country_names_and_code_elements">
          Maintenance Agency for ISO 3166 country codes</a>). That is, a
          language range is composed of one or more <dfn>subtags</dfn> that are
          delimited by a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-"). For example, the
          '<code>en-AU</code>' language range represents English as spoken in
          Australia, and '<code>fr-CA</code>' represents French as spoken in
          Canada. Language tags that meet the validity criteria of [[!RFC5646]]
          section 2.2.9 that can be verified without reference to the IANA
          Language Subtag Registry are considered structurally valid.

          Localizable members
        </h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>localizable member</dfn> is member of the <a>application
          manifest</a> that can appear in the <var>locales</var> member.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for retrieving a localizable member from the
          manifest</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The algorithm
          prioritizes returning the localized version of a member over one
          where the locale is unknown. The algorithm returns either a value
          from the namifest or <code>undefined</code>.

          activity whose name matches the property name. Activity names are
          free-form text, and each activity is represented by an object. This
          object MUST contain the following property:

                The page handling the activity is opened in a new "window" (on a
                mobile device, for example, this view will replace the original

                supports and subsequently execute the activity for which it
                receives a message. Further, if the activity requires a return
                value, the page MUST call <code>activity.postResult</code> or
                <code>activity.postError</code> (where <code>activity</code> is
                the first argument provided to the function specified by

          <dd>
            <p>
              As the application manifest format is JSON and will commonly be
              encoded using [[!!Unicode]], the security considerations
              described in [[!JSON]] and [[!UTR36]] apply. In addition,
              implementers need to impose their own implementation-specific
              limits on the values of otherwise unconstrained member types,
              e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against
              running out of memory, or to work around platform-specific
              limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The manifest document allows authors, through the permissions and
              required_features, to request permission to enable security
              sensitive APIs. As these APIs are outside the scope of this
              specification, significant caution needs to be taken when
              granting an application the capability to use a feature. Features
              themselves define their own security considerations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web applications will generally contain ECMAscript, HTML, CSS
              files, and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed
              environment. As such, implementers need to be aware of the
              security implications for the types they support. Specifically,
              implementers need to consider the security implications outlined
              in the [[!CSS-MIME]] specification, the [[!ECMAScript-MIME]]
              specification, and the [[!HTML-MIME]] specification.
            </p>
            <p>
              As web applications can contain content that is able to
              simultaneously interact with the local device and a remote host,
              implementers need to consider the privacy implications resulting
              from exposing private information to a remote host. Mitigation
              and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
              responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However,
              in designing these measures, implementers are advised to enable
              user awareness of information sharing, and to provide easy access
              to interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this specification relies on the standardized heuristics for
              determining the content type of files defined in the [[!SNIFF]]
              specification, implementers need to consider the security
              considerations discussed in the [[!SNIFF]] specification.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this specification allows for the declaration of IRIs within
              certain members of a the application manifest, implementers need
              to consider the security considerations discussed in the [IRI]
              specification. Implementations intending to display <abbr title=
              "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and
              <abbr title="Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses
              found in the application manifest are strongly encouraged to
              follow the security advice given in [[!UTR36]].
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, user agents need to be careful about trusting path
              components found in the manifest. Such path components might be
              interpreted by operating systems as pointing at security critical
              files outside the browsing environment proper, and naive
              unpacking of zip packages into the file system might lead to
              undesirable and security relevant effects, such as overwriting of
              system files.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If a marketplace wants to guarantee that an application is safe,
          it allows it to review the application codes and makes sure that all
          permissions granted can't be used outside of the reviewed code. In
          addition, it forces, by design, that any update will go trough the
          same review process.
          </li>
          <li>Some developers might want to develop for the Web Platform
          without investing in a server infrastructure. Any client-side only
          applications written on top of the Web Platform will be able to be
          very easily distributed that way.

        installed applications has not been updated. To know if the file has
        been updated, HTTP semantics apply.

      <p>
        For <a>package applications</a>, both <a>application manifest</a>s
        (outside and inside the package) SHOULD be updated. However, the
        <a>application manifest</a> inside the package SHOULD always be checked

        Data isolation
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the context of a running application, all usual rules for data
        isolation MUST apply: same-origin policy, same-domain policy, or
        whatever is used. However, between two applications, those rules no
        longer apply. Two applications MUST be fully isolated from each other
        in the sense that they SHOULD NOT be able to access data from each
        other. For example, if App1 accesses <i>http://example.org</i> and gets
        a cookie from it, App2 should not be able to see that cookie when
        accessing <i>http://example.org</i> even if the usual cookie sharing
        policy should allow this to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isolation SHOULD apply for all data storage like <i>cookies</i>,
        <i>localStorage</i>, <i>IndexedDB</i>, <i>app cache</i> and any other
        Web Platform mechanism that allows to store data and does not
        explicitly opt out from the application data isolation.<br>
        The isolation SHOULD also apply to UA specifics data storage. For
        example, any permission granted or denied to a host/origin/domain
        should be isolated per-application or auto-fill and auto-completion
        features for forms.

        Depending on the user interface around the application context,
        navigating outside the <a>application's origin</a> might lock the user
        out of the application. To prevent that, the UA SHOULD NOT allow
        navigation out of the <a>application's origin</a>, unless the origin is
        specified in the following <a>application manifest</a> property:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <dfn id='prop-allow-navigation'>allow-navigation</dfn>: the property
          SHOULD contain an array of origins that can be navigated to from the
          application.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the application tries to navigate to an unauthorized origin, the UA
        SHOULD open the link in a regular but distinct browsing context.

          Some API might allow the application to access sensitive parts of the
          hardware or sensitive information. To prevent applications to access
          them, some APIs might require one or more permissions. For example,

          Permission declaration

        <p>
          An application SHOULD define all permissions it is going to use in

            Use cases
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some applications require access to APIs which, if abused, may
            cause significant damage to the end user's services, data or
            devices. For example, an API allowing the use of SMS could be
            misused by a malicious application to send unwanted premium-rate
            messages costing the user money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the impact of using a malicious application with these
            privileges is higher, additional security mechanisms and processes
            are necessary to minimize the additional risk they present. This
            might include, for example, mandatory review of applications or
            certification. A simple user-authorized permission system is
            considered insufficient: users could be tricked into granting a
            malicious application access to inappropriate APIs, services or
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a complement to permissioning, this specification defines a
            <em>privileged</em> class of application. Applications which are
            not privileged will not be able to access potentially dangerous
            APIs.

            trustworthy.

          </p>
          <p>
            In both cases, the application SHOULD be considered as privileged
            by the UA if the UA considers the installation origin as trusted,

            Security considerations
          </h2>
          <p>
            UA should keep in mind that a signed package is way more secure
            than a signed manifest. A correctly signed package can only be
            compromised if the private key has been compromised or the
            cryptographic algorithm. A UA should not trust an installation
            origin if it does not trust its ability to keep safe its private
            key.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hands, a signed manifest only proves that the
            application is genuinely trusted (if the private key was not
            compromised nor the cryptographic algorithm). Anything else can be
            compromised given that it lives in the Internet. There is no need
            to list all possible attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important difference between a <a>packaged application</a> and a
            <a>hosted application</a> is the ability to review the code. Any
            permission granted to a <a>packaged application</a> will be granted
            to the code inside the package only. That means trusting such
            application is way easier after a code review, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, code review for <a>packaged application</a>s could be
            avoided if the installation origin trusts enough an application
            developer. Such developer could get all its <a>packaged
            application</a>s trusted without too much risk for the users.<br>
            The same thing could be done for <a>hosted application</a> except
            that it would be recommended to make sure that the developer has
            strong server security or would not risk any security flaw on their
            servers.

        <h2>
          Application states
        </h2>
        <p>
          At any time, an application MUST be in one of the following states:
          <a>running</a>, <a>paused</a>, <a>terminated</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An application is <dfn>running</dfn> when it has been launched by the
          UA and has not been put in <a>paused</a>. A <a>running</a>
          application can transition to <a>paused</a> or <a>terminated</a>
          states.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>running</a> application transitions to a <a>paused</a> state,
          the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>pause</code> on
          the <a>Application</a> object before switching its state.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>running</a> application transitions to a <a>terminated</a>
          state, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
          <code>terminate</code> on the <a>Application</a> object before
          shutting down the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          An application is <dfn>paused</dfn> when the UA stops the execution
          of an application without terminating it. A <a>paused</a> application
          SHOULD have all its scripts no longer running, such as rendering,
          parsing, processing media files and any action that requires CPU and
          memory or would distract the user. A <a>paused</a> application can
          transition to <a>running</a> or <a>terminated</a> states.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>paused</a> application transitions to a <a>running</a> state,
          the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>resume</code> on
          the <a>Application</a> object after changing its state.
        </p>
        <p>
          An application is <dfn>terminated</dfn> when the application has been
          stopped and is no longer loaded in the system. The state of a
          <a>terminated</a> application can only be changed to <a>running</a>
          if the application is launched again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>terminated</a> application transitions to a <a>running</a>
          state, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
          <code>launch</code> on the <a>Application</a> object after the main
          browsing context is created but before the <code>load</code> and
          <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> events are fired.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class='issue'>
        <p>
          The specification currently assumes that one will save important when
          paused so there is no terminate event when transitioning from pause
          to terminate.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class='issue'>
        <p>
          Do we have real use cases for <code>launch</code>?<br>
          Is firing before <code>load</code> a hard thing to do?

        <h2>
          Consequences of visibility
        </h2>
        <p>
          While an application is running, it can be part or fully hidden. The
          visibility events described in [[!PAGE-VISIBILITY]] MUST be sent when
          the visibility status of the application changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, when the application becomes fully hidden, the UA MAY
          put the application in a <a>paused</a> state.

          Use cases
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some methods want to return a value or do an action but can't do it
          synchronously, most of the time for performance reasons. In that
          case, most of those methods will use a callback mechanism to inform
          the caller of the success or the failure of the action.<br>
          However, this callback mechanism makes the code barely readable and
          there is no common pattern used by all API in the Web Platform.<br>
          <a>DOMRequest</a> intend to be used instead of those callbacks to
          make those APIs more developer-friendly and help code readability.

        <h2>
          Definition
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <a>DOMRequest</a> interface is intended to be used by
          asynchronous methods that want to return something after performing
          an action or simply want to inform the caller that the action is
          done. It returned request can also be used to inform that an error
          happened during the operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>DOMRequest</a> has three state. It is whether
          <code>pending</code>, <code>success</code> or <code>error</code>.<br>
          The initial state of a <a>DOMRequest</a> MUST be
          <code>pending</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives a <a>success message</a> while in the
          <code>pending</code> state, its state MUST change to
          <code>success</code> and SHOULD NOT change afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives an <a>error message</a> while in the
          <code>pending</code> state, its state MUST change to
          <code>error</code> and SHOULD NOT change afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives a <a>success message</a> or an
          <a>error message</a> while not in the <code>pending</code> state, the
          message MUST be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>success message</dfn> SHOULD be sent to the <a>DOMRequest</a>
          when the operation is successfully terminated. The message MAY
          contain a value which MUST be used by the <code>result</code>
          attribute. If the message does not contain a value, <i>null</i> MUST
          be used instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as a <a>success message</a> is received,
          <code>readyState</code> MUST return <code>done</code>,
          <code>result</code> MUST return the received value or <i>null</i> as
          explained above and the object MUST NOT change its state and MUST,
          therefore, ignore all following <a>success message</a> and <a>error
          message</a>.<br>
          Finally, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
          <code>success</code> on the object
        </p>
        <p>
          An <dfn>error message</dfn> SHOULD be sent to the <a>DOMRequest</a>
          when the operation has failed. The message MAY contain a value which
          MUST be a <a>DOMError</a> object and MUST be used by the
          <code>error</code> attribute. If the message does not contain a
          value, the UA SHOULD find the most appropriate <a>DOMError</a> that
          represents the failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as an <a>error message</a> is received,
          <code>readyState</code> MUST return <code>done</code>,
          <code>error</code> MUST return the received value the most
          appropriate error value as explained above and the object MUST NOT
          change its state and MUST, therefore, ignore all following <a>success
          message</a> and <a>error message</a>.<br>
          Finally, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
          <code>error</code> on the object.

        Relationship to Widgets
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification builds on the lessons learned from the "widgets"
        work previously undertaken at the W3C - and expands on it significantly
        with many new enabling features for the Web platform. So, although on
        the surface there are many similarities between packaged applications
        and "widgets", the types of applications defined in this specification
        differ from w3c widgets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, thanks to hosted applications, it is no longer a requirement
        that applications be packaged in a Zip file. This makes it possible to
        provide application metadata and configuration options for all
        applications on the Web - not just those inside Zip files - in a way
        that is backwards compatible with legacy user agents and user agents
        that don't support this specification.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Hosted apps are just Web apps, hence can rely on parts of the Web
        platform that are inherently tied to HTTP/S and the concept of same
        origin. This makes it significantly easier to perform cross domain
        requests using CORS, instead having to set special access rules using
        WARP.
        </li>
        <li>Shift to JSON. Although few people complained in practice about
        Widget Configuration documents being XML, the move to JSON is more in
        line with what modern web applications are using.
        </li>
        <li>Better control over content security. As W3C widgets were
        standardized long before Content Security Policy, they were not able to
        make use of the technology. CSP allows finer-grained control over where
        content can be sourced from than WARP.
